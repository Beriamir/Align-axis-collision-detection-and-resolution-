# Circle and Box Collision Detection with Resolution

## Overview
This project implements a basic collision detection and resolution system for 2D physics simulations,
specifically focusing on the interaction between axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) and circles.
The system includes both collision detection and resolution with impulse and friction applied to the objects involved.
Note that the current implementation does not apply any rotational considerations in the impulse solver.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript: For physics calculations and collision detection logic.
